# NYU-Case-Study

### Data-Driven Insights on Employee Retention, Satisfaction, and Workforce Trends

This project is an applied HR analytics case study I completed during my undergraduate studies at the Universiry of Virginia. The analysis uses real-world-style HR data from LA Fitness to explore workforce patterns, employee turnover, and satisfaction metrics through Python-based data analysis and visualization.

This project not only deepened my passion for combining **psychology, data science, and organizational analysis**, but it also **helped me earn admission into NYU’s M.A. in Industrial-Organizational Psychology program**. I ultimately chose to pursue my graduate studies at **The George Washington University**, where I continue to expand on this line of research in applied psychology and workforce analytics.

## Project Overview

This case study applies HR and data-driven principles to identify workforce trends, predict turnover, and visualize organizational structure within LA Fitness.
The main goals of the project were to:

* Analyze demographic and role distributions across the organization
* Examine turnover rates and their relationship to employee satisfaction
* Explore potential predictors of retention (e.g., tenure, job role, and performance metrics)
* Present findings through clear, professional data visualizations

---

## Dataset

The dataset, titled `LA_Fit_Data_Fall_2025.xlsx`, contains over 7,500 employee records with variables such as:

* **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Ethnicity
* **Employment:** Job Title, Job Status (Full-Time/Part-Time), Department
* **Performance & Satisfaction:** Tenure, Satisfaction Score, Turnover Indicator

Data cleaning and preprocessing were conducted using Pandas and NumPy, followed by visualization and exploratory analysis in Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Visualizations

* **Gender Distribution** – Proportion of male vs. female employees
* **Ethnicity Distribution** – Representation across different ethnic groups
* **Age Distribution** – Age breakdown by department and role
* **Job Role Distribution** – Visualization of workforce composition
* **Tenure by Role** – Average tenure across roles and departments
* **Turnover Analysis** – Visual trends in voluntary vs. involuntary exits
* **Satisfaction vs. Turnover** – Relationship between satisfaction score and retention

Each visualization was designed to be **intuitive, reproducible, and presentation-ready**, ensuring interpretability for both technical and non-technical audiences.

---

## Key Insights

* **High turnover** rates were concentrated among part-time and entry-level roles
* **Employee satisfaction** emerged as a potential predictor of retention
* **Tenure and job level** demonstrated strong associations with turnover probability
* Patterns revealed opportunities for improved **engagement and career development initiatives**

---

## Next Steps

Future extensions of this project could include:

* Predictive modeling for **turnover probability** using logistic regression or tree-based models
* Integration of **survey-based psychological metrics** (e.g., motivation, burnout)
* Development of an **interactive dashboard** using Plotly or Streamlit

---

## Personal Note

This project reflects my passion for using **data-driven methods to understand human behavior at work**. It became a key portfolio piece that showcased my technical and analytical skills, playing a major role in my graduate school admissions journey.
